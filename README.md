Prog to discover file names
I wanted to discover the file syntax to use to in programs to access things like OneDrive and Dropbox.  This program uses the file selector
tool to do this.  Run in debug mode, select an example file, and then (using visual studio), hover over the file variable to get the 
correct name for the file.
